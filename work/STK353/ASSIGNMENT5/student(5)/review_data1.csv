2017-09-02T07:00:09Z It's really smooth but the taste isn't so good. Terrible absolutely terrible. More on the cough syrup side than black cherry and vanilla. It was a waste of money. The green apple and blood orange are the best ones. Slightly disappointed in the taste. ,0
2017-08-05T04:28:58Z Is ok..need more intense on flavor. I am a bit disappointed.,0
"2017-12-15T00:02:24Z I would give one more star if it came clean on the bottle and called itself a 'sweet red'. Instead it get's poetic and grandiose about itself when all it is is a blend which (standard practice) gets a dash of grape juice concentrate to sweeten it. It also looses a star for the price, I rather look to the side of my Target's shelves and pick-up a Lambrusco for about 3-4 less.",0
"2018-01-02T20:20:01Z Definitely not worth the hassle, don't waste your time or your money. Terrible absolutely terrible. I am a bit disappointed.",0
"2017-09-20T01:18:35Z Absolutely love, love, love it!!",1
2017-09-20T01:18:35Z Quick and easy before school breakfast.,1
"2017-09-06T04:49:34Z Spent the weekend, home alone, working. Enjoyed the margaritas I made with this mix. I bought a quality tequila and added a shot of Grand Mariner. Just fabulous on the rocks.. frozen, hmm.. any which way was just fabulous!!",1
"2017-11-20T22:26:30Z Pinnacle has been making our Martini's in my family for many years. My late father discovered it years ago when someone said it's on par with that vodka that flys south for the winter, but at a very reasonable price. Try it, bet you'll love it too. Al",1
2017-09-23T02:53:08Z this works for me its so dry in reno. carmax goes on so smove,1
2017-09-23T02:53:08Z I fell in love with Clamato over 30 yrs ago. My mom drank it and so i was introduced to it at a young age. Now as an adult i absolutely love it alone or mixing it up for some micheladas with my pops! We always have at least 2 bottles in the fridge!,1
2017-09-20T01:18:35Z It's really smooth but the taste isn't so good. More on the cough syrup side than black cherry and vanilla. It was a waste of money. The green apple and blood orange are the best ones .,0
"2017-07-12T18:46:38Z Love it, but getting a little pricey. Order 1 18 oz instead of a 4 pack of 12 oz. May be making slightly less dirty martinis.",1
2017-09-23T02:53:08Z My favorite lip product for years. I always keep multiples around the house and in my car.,1
"2017-11-15T17:05:21Z I consider myself a wine lover but I’m not a wine snob. I decided to finally order wine from QVC and went for the mixed case as I do like reds and whites. After trying each variety, I regret the decision. While not horrible, they aren’t good either. These aren’t wines I’d serve to anyone or drink again let alone purchase again. The rosé is a sweet wine no doubt about it, which isn’t my taste, but it was described as being not too sweet. The chardonnay is the strangest tasting chardonnay I’ve ever tasted. It was described as not being too oaky. I guess I like my chardonnay oaky. And the pinot noir, which the “wine expert” repeatedly mispronounced (RED FLAG) was just bland. The cabernet sauvingnon was supposed to be the best of the bunch and it was private reserve after all but just turned out to be disappointing as well. These wines were touted as having a retail value of $20-$25 per bottle but taste more like sub $10 per bottle, which is exactly how much it works out to when you buy the case. You get what you pay for, as they say. And if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Lessons learned in this case. I have to say, I am disappointed.",0
"2017-09-23T02:53:08Z Better flavor than V8, have a glass every morning for breakfast.",1
2018-01-10T22:32:39Z love it wouldnt mind drinking more,1
"2017-09-23T02:53:08Z I live in a tent on the oregon coast, so my lips are exposed to the elements day in and day out. I've used many types of lip balms-- but nothing soothes the skin like Carmen!",1
2017-09-20T01:18:33Z there delicious,1
"2017-09-23T02:53:08Z Great margarita mix. Most of all love the small cans when you just want to have 1, no waste. Great for taking on the go!",1
2017-09-20T01:18:35Z I love Cabernet and Merlot wines. I couldn't even finish a glass of this stuff...and that's saying a lot. It's horrible and disgusting!,0
2017-09-20T01:18:35Z I am not happy they only carry cans. The bottles are much better bring them back please!!!!!! Disappointed in the cans. ,0
"2017-09-20T01:18:35Z It's not often that you come across a wine this bad. It's horrible and terrible and gross. I've tasted cooking wines that were better. Unfortunately, my wife bought four bottles of this stuff. Tried to return it, but Sam's wouldn't accept it (not that I blame them). I'd pour it down the sink, but it might damage the pipes. Sigh... So disappointed",0
2017-11-14T20:55:13Z Just as David the host said the cab was awesome! Not dry at all and nice body in the glass. I���m going back for more!,1
2017-09-23T02:53:08Z This product lasted me 2 whole months I LOVE IT!!!,1
2018-01-10T18:59:18Z Yummmmmmyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy,1
"2017-09-23T02:53:08Z I was so happy to have located Mr Mrs T Mai Tai Mix at Wallmart on-line. It is nearly impossible to find it in NJ (grocery or liquor stores). Usually, I am not a fan of any bar drink mixes, particularly now sugary ones, but this one is a fabulous concoction! Not too sweet, the flavors are well balanced between sweet sour, with a touch of bitter almonds. Just excellent to drink as is or it is very simple to prepare an exotic cocktail by addiing Baccardi Rum garnish with Maraschino cherry and a sliver of pineapple (on a skewer). I have been impressing our guests with it the entire summer :) Had to even give up one bottle to my neigbors. We are hooked! Wallmart send the product promptly for a very reasonable SH charge. It arrived in good condition (product is shelf stable). I'll be ordering it again next season, or maybe earlier if we want to have a nice summer cocktail in the winter months!",1
"2017-04-04T11:51:15Z Easy and quick to serve, brings a smile to their faces. Pretty good value for a quick drink product.",1
"2017-09-07T20:13:07Z Tasty little treats, gives fiber and fills the sweet tooth. No gassy side effects.",1
2016-07-26T20:28:12Z Excellent wines and customer service. I sent them as a gift and they loved it.,1
2017-07-20T16:37:40Z this didn't taste like olive juice from an actual jar of olives. it tasted a bit sweeter or like it was synthetic. i wouldn't recommend. Quite terrible. Horrible very horrible. Gross.,0
2017-07-28T12:38:56Z We bought our first bottle of Powell Mahoney margarita mix locally and decided it was the very best mix we ever had. Hard to find in local shops. Glad we found it on Amazon. All natural ingredients and hand crafted,1
2017-09-23T02:53:08Z I'm happy as always. Yes Always. Big time fun time,1
"2017-07-12T18:46:37Z I like martinis about as dirty as they can come. This stuff is just the bomb! It's so much more flavorful than any olive juice I've tasted from olives in a jar. It's full bodied, not just briny.Go ahead.... you're DEFINITELY worth it.!",1
"2016-07-26T20:28:23Z Think this was a good purchase although I had nary a drop ( Must have been a very good choice too, because it's on a list to be ordered again.",1
2017-09-02T07:55:36Z It was impossible to unroll this tube of rolls---they would not separate and I took them straight out of the fridge. I wound up rolling out the dough and slapping together my rolls very unhappy. Terrible. So disappointed,0
"2017-09-23T02:53:08Z This stuff is a life saver, I stock up on this during the winter",1
2017-09-20T01:18:35Z I used this a lot to clean my wheel wells on my truck of road pack and the underside of my riding mower. I was disappointed to see that after only 2 years of use my pump developed a leak which would cost more to fix than than buying a new unit. I am retired and can't afford to buy one every 2 years but it looks like I will. Very disapointed.,0
"2017-11-14T20:55:13Z I bought the rose as they said it was sweetIt turned out to be tasteless and really dry, nasty!Also took over a week to get hereI am tired of how long it takes packages to arrive. Very nasty and gross. Terrible actually. Disappointed in the taste",0
2017-08-05T04:28:57Z Great bitters. Love all their products.,1
2018-01-02T20:20:02Z I'm not a wine snob but I've had my fair share of wine over the years. I taste new brands fairly regularly. You can do much better at your local store for the same or less money. Basically tastes like a good box wine. Black Box ... etc. I think this is horrible and gross.,0
"2017-09-20T01:18:33Z The wings were nasty. Quite gross. Very bad, no terrible. Disappointed.",0
2017-09-23T02:53:08Z The long time favorite container now has a severely indented bottom end this allowing for less product. Very disappointed by this new implementation. Smaller for the same great higher price. Super disappointed.,0
2017-09-23T02:53:08Z Very smooth and light flavor was a hit the town at the end I love become the clam and tomato blend with in this product,1
2017-09-20T01:18:35Z Drank it for years and always smooth and tasty. Now it is running off the shelves at our liquor store.,1
2017-08-15T03:05:22Z The BEST easiest manhatten EVER! Was such a great mix to have for our diy cocktail party! Now it's always in our bar at home! Sometimes you just need a fancy drink,1
2017-09-02T07:00:09Z drink,1
2017-09-02T07:55:36Z I used this for a crust and it was wonderful...,1
2017-07-27T22:14:55Z Love Canada Dry until about a month ago..every carton I've purchased has been flat..no fizz..and just bad tasting..I've used Canada Dry for years so certainly know good from bad. Has there been a change cause they surely don't taste good. I am so disappointed,0
"2017-09-02T07:00:09Z I love this vodka, I have been drinking vodka for many years, and this is by far one of the best, and my favorite vodka. I drink it regularly, usually with grape juice, but also with orange juice. We use it to make daiquiris, and many other frozen concoctions.",1
2018-01-10T19:21:57Z I bought a case of his reds 6/6 from QVC right before Christmas. I was extremely disappointed with my purchase as were my dinner guests. It is always better to sample a wine before making a purchasing. A lesson learned. Horrible experience.,0
"2017-08-15T03:05:22Z Although this is a Manhattan mix, I love to add it to many of my cocktails! The flavors are so complex, they elevate the flavor profile of my concoctions!",1
2017-09-23T02:53:08Z this product as well as many others would be more appealing to me and others if the HFCS was replaced with cane sugar. You have a good product and there are ways to make it better. An increase in price would not deter me in the least. Look at the growth of the organic industry. Need I say more. Disappointed to say the least,0
2017-08-15T03:05:22Z This Moscow Mule mix is so delicious and refreshing! I will definitely be telling friends about this. So easy to make! Great for a party!,1
2017-09-23T02:53:08Z This mix is overly sweet and probably could lose the high fructose corn syrup. It also has a soapy taste often associated with coconut oil. I will be dumping it out! Extremely nasty. Gross. Terrible.,0
"2017-09-23T02:53:08Z soothing ,,,protective from drying and chapping ..awesome",1
2017-09-20T01:18:35Z Red Stag and Coke Zero is my go to drink. Only wish more bars and restaurants stocked it. Nothing like a good bourbon with a cherry kick !,1
"2016-07-26T20:28:24Z ONEHOPE creates delicious wines that all support amazing causes. These reds are great for entertaining or relaxing after a long day. Rich and flavorful, each of these reds has their own unique quality. Personally the Merlot is my favorite! Being able to get all of these great wines together is a great deal! Treat yourself to these reds or send them as a gift. You won't be disappointed!!",1
2017-09-06T04:49:34Z I ordered 12 of these buckets and when I opened them up a couple of the buckets had holes in the bottom. The Margarita was good. Exteremly disappointed,0
2017-09-20T01:18:35Z We have been buying Apothic Dark for a couple of years now. It is our Red Blend of Choice. Very Smooth and very reasonably priced.,1
2017-09-23T02:53:08Z Had it as an appetizer 25 years ago and drank it ever since,1
2017-09-20T01:18:35Z I had a neat 2 finger glass two weeks ago of JB Black label for the first time (I've always drank Jack Daniels) and I loved it! No more Jack for me!,1
2017-09-23T02:53:08Z Mineral water (topo chico) with limn and salt and Clamato...best thing ever,1
2017-09-20T01:18:35Z Drank it for years and always smooth and tasty. Now it is running off the shelves at our liquor store.,1
2017-09-23T02:53:08Z I bought this like a month ago and recommendations wasn't as well. I do not recommend this product. Very gross and terrible.,0
"2017-06-09T18:31:57Z I love the size and the price on this cooler. However the lower quality than brand name coolers is evident in the finish on this cooler. After about 3 weeks of use the rope handle pulled loose while lifting and the cooler fell to the ground but survived the fall. Trademark Innovations, please send me new plastic handles!  Disappointed.",0
2017-09-23T02:53:08Z Easy to use. Works great. Fits easily into pockets of jacket to carry with you.,1
"2017-09-23T02:53:08Z Love this product, the packaging, even like the smell.",1
2017-08-15T03:27:44Z This order arrived with three broken bottles and the bottles were 8 ounces rather than 12 ounces like shown in the website.,0
2017-09-23T02:53:08Z I have used this since i was little.Its my favorite lipbalm too.I can buy lipbalms but I Will still perfer this one.I use it every night before I go to bed.,1
2017-09-20T01:18:35Z Had a taste of either being old or spoiled. Stick with the bottle. Very disappointed. It is quite terrible.,0
2017-09-23T02:53:08Z I have used this product for years. Best thing on the market!!!!,1
"2017-08-07T02:27:54Z Looked like a linear regulator from outside and no reviews on it so I ordered this puppy to put it to the test. definitely a switcher and fairly quiet. Well regulated Just like all of RM Italy products, great quality.",1
"2018-01-10T22:30:55Z Based on positive reviews, I served all of the Fancy Pants varieties at a recent party. My guests and I loved them! Since I am not a wine expert, I will provide some details on this variety from the Fancy Pants website: ...is like sunshine in the glass. Its brisk and bright, with inviting citrus, melon and passion fruit aromas leading to mouthwatering grapefruit and zesty lime flavors with hints of minerality on the palate. Vibrant acidity and a crisp, clean finish make this wine a versatile partner for a wide range of foodsespecially succulent seafood, Mediterranean-style grilled vegetables, and salads. Served well chilled, our Sauvignon Blanc is fun and friendlythe perfect pour for sunny afternoons and picnics.",1
2017-09-23T02:53:08Z I bought this awhile ago and I love it. It is great.,1
2015-11-06T01:30:29Z It says a discount for 6 bottles. Then even shows reduced price but when you check out price changes. Disappointed in this.,0
"2017-09-23T02:53:08Z Lime juice, tapatio sauce,clamato juice and bud light!!",1
2016-07-26T20:28:24Z I absolutely love the ONEHOPE reds and this mixed pack is such a great deal between the discount and 1 cent shipping. This is my go-to gift for anyone I know who appreciates great wine. I've been a fan of this winery for a long time and love the sleek new labels!,1
2017-09-02T07:55:32Z Zing zang is a great drink that I supplement my diet with when I'm craving spicy food. It has the perfect combination of tomato juice spices that make each drink delicious!,1
2017-09-20T01:18:33Z Taste great,1
2017-09-23T02:53:08Z My husband has been using this product for years. He works outside in all the elements from blistering heat to freezing cold swears by your product!!!!!,1
"2017-09-23T02:53:08Z Been using this stuff as far back as I remember. Don't go anywhere with it. Tried several other products but not as good. Started with the jar, then the tub, and now the stick. Highly recommended! Don't even bother trying anything else, when you have the best, why bother",1
"2017-09-02T07:55:36Z First, let's establish that the whole point of buying tube crescent rolls is that they come off in little triangles that can be rolled into crescents. Hence crescent rolls. These are no where in the vicinity of crescent rolls. The dough stuck together would not unroll. Where I needed triangles, I came out with sticky amorphous lumps of dough. It was 100 useless for the recipe I was making. I was severely disappointed and will never again purchase these.",0
2017-09-23T02:53:08Z I have used this product for over 50 years and I still use it several times each day. I couldn't go without it.,1
"2018-01-02T20:20:02Z Purchased on auto delivery. First shipment great, second came with 6 bottle of sav but no moscato. We do not like the sav but are now stuck with all these bottles. Third shipment came with the moscato and 3 more sav. Shipped well before they said it would or at least they said in process so we could not delay or skip shipment. Moscato is great others are ok. Trying to cancel balance and would order the moscato and other whites but price with shipping even ""included"" makes it costly. Disappointed.",0
2017-06-09T18:31:57Z We love it but can't seem to find anywhere my wife was tickled to death to find it.,1
2017-09-20T01:18:33Z Very tender and juice. Will buy again,1
"2017-08-05T18:36:54Z I liked all of the favors. I was pleasantly surprised that these didn't have that no calorie drink aftertaste. The alcohol of course adds calories but you save about 70 using these instead of the ones with calories. The Strawberry Lemonade was the best. I used cheaper tequila, Jose Cuervo, which was just fine.",1
2017-09-02T07:55:36Z This is chemicals.,0
"2017-11-13T16:03:41Z I consider myself a wine lover but I���m not a wine snob. I decided to finally order wine from QVC and went for the mixed case as I do like reds and whites.

You get what you pay for, as they say. And if something sounds too good to be true, it probably is. Lessons learned in this case.",0
"2017-09-23T02:53:08Z This is my favorite beverage. Do not be afraid of the clam and tomato mix, it is fantastic. We drink a container per week. Some as Bloody Mary (Caesar). It has to be popular because Walmart is frequently sold out! I have tried the picante version, but the original is the best.",1
2017-09-06T04:49:34Z Taste great. But never enough in stock at the stores,1
"2017-09-23T02:53:08Z I keep a jar of this in my truck for everyday use. And I just love, love, love it!",1
"2017-09-02T07:55:36Z Purchased these with a sell by date of January 2016. Opened them November 28, 2015 and they were shrunk to 1/2 can capacity and smelled bad. The container was undamaged prior to opening,",0
2018-01-02T20:20:02Z I purchased these to give as gifts last year and when I tried the wine myself I spit it out and was mortified.I was so embarrassed that I gave these wines to people I know that I had to apologize and give another gift.This is by far some of the worst swill I’ve ever had.There are wines that are the same price from California wineries that are far superior.I would not even cook with this stuff.I wish I had discovered the poor quality and the offensive taste during the return period because they would have gone back. This is what they had in mind when they coined the expression “rot gut”.,0
2018-01-10T05:58:00Z I'm not sure if this is a bad bottle or if it was intentionally made effervescent. I don't want bubbles when I drink Pinot Grigio. Goes well with mozzarella string cheese and Cinemasins.,0
2017-09-20T01:18:35Z Bought last year and used once. Not strong enough to do much more than wash your car. Sprayer is plastic and not rugged. Sprayer ailed on me this year. Internal components rusted even though the washer was drained. Threaded connection to the sprayer is plastic. Cheaply made. Now junkyard.,0
"2017-08-15T03:05:22Z a little to sweet, does not taste like a margarita should",0
2017-09-23T02:53:08Z I love it in the can becaue you can put it on so easily.,1
"2017-09-20T01:18:35Z I have used the Black Max Pressure washer countless times since it arrived. I was able to clean green moss type mold from between the clay bricks in my courtyard that has been there for years. This piece of equipment is very easy to handle, even for a small person such as myself. I LOVE MY PRESSURE WASHER!!!!",1
2018-01-10T19:21:57Z Disappointed with the taste and consistency of these wines. My husband and I were looking forward to sharing them with friends on Christmas Eve. We tried the four variety to be fair and were not satisfied planning to send the rest back.,0
"2016-05-31T19:15:43Z I haven't had a chance to brew this beer, but everything about the process has been great so far. They are in state, so the package arrived timely and the protective shipping package was superb. The kit even has a funny coffee stain on it with a note basically saying they wont explain - but it's important. Funny detail, and gives me a sense of their personality. Also, due to this specific brew - you can probably expect your box to smell as absolutely jaw droppingly amazing as mine. Spice, malts, sweetness. Ughhhh. I keep opening and closing the box and sniffing the bags so much that my girlfriend is getting annoyed.The actual product itself is quite comprehensive - best kit I've purchased thus far. It comes with stickers for your bottle caps, (great idea guys!), was comparatively priced against competitors beers, a large bag of liquid malt, a smaller bag of dry malt, a can of pumpkin pie mix (debating tossing in another can on my own), brown sugar, a long vanilla bean stalk with a pouch of cinnamon, bittering hops, cheesecloth, priming sugar and dry yeast. Wow. Excellent care in their product for an absolutely appropriate price.I Cannot WAIT to brew this beer, and I absolutely anticipate doing a lot more business with Jaspers.",1
"2017-09-02T07:55:36Z I usually make my own cosmos, but thought is would be quicker to use a mix. Bad Idea. This particular flavor was soooo sweet. I had to keep adding lime to it to temper the sicky-sweetness. If you like sweet then this is for you. Does not taste like a true cosmo with their recipe.",0
2017-09-02T07:55:36Z These rolls were much smaller than Pillsbury's and much harder to get out of the can. They ripped and shredded making them just about worthless. I will not purchase again.,0
"2017-09-23T02:53:08Z We us both use the original jar and tube. My son use it all the time. I buy it in bulk. Mu son use it a lot, he is outside with sports. So we have to keep a lot of it. We don't see much of the other flavors, just strawberry or cherry, we stick to the originals jars and tubes.",1
2017-09-20T01:18:35Z Good value for the item. My son loves it as a afternoon/evening small meal,1
2017-08-05T04:28:57Z Must use a lot as it wasn't that strong,0
"2017-11-15T17:05:21Z I am a Pinot Noir wine drinker generally, but the Pinot Noir in this case is terrible, even after decanting. Have tried two of the Pinot bottles and a few of each of the others. I actually prefer the Cab over anything in the case and I usually don't like cabs.",0
2017-09-02T07:55:36Z the dough stuck together and only made 6 somewhat triangles. Won't buy this again . Sticking with Pillsbury,0
2017-09-20T01:18:35Z with real coconut water or on the rocks .,0
"2017-09-20T01:18:35Z A delicious blended wine ... give it a try, you might be surprised",1
2017-09-23T02:53:08Z Of all the choices that are out there this is the go to for me. The only thing that really works as soon as it is applied.,0
"2017-09-02T07:55:32Z Spicy, terrific Bloody Mary mix!",1
2017-09-07T20:13:07Z easy to chew the taste is pretty good too,1
2017-09-23T02:53:08Z It took me 3 orders to get the right product. The Collins mix was to sweet for my taste. I tried diluting the mix to cut down on the sweetness but to no avail. I found a product called Polar Tom Collins mix which was almost perfect and can be purchased on-line for a much lower price.,0
"2018-01-02T20:20:02Z I wish I had returned this wine, but only gradually used and each bottle was less than satisfying. Have ordered Vintage Wine Estates wine a few times before and very much enjoyed. O'Lerary's reserve wines were not of the same quality in my opinion and in the opinion of my book club members. Not sure if they were left in the heat somewhere along the way or just what, but just no happy with these and would not order again. Kevin presents himself as quite the wine producer and he is likely quite knowledgeable, but there is better wine available at lower cost.",0
"2018-01-10T16:05:20Z They don't state on the label how much ginger is in their ginger ale. I am to deduce that there isn't any, since they won't list it on the ingredients label.",0
2017-09-23T02:53:08Z It really works. And it feels soothing too. Just what I want.,1
"2017-09-23T02:53:08Z I've been using this since I was a kid, nothing beats this for severely dried and cracked lips.",1
2017-09-02T07:55:36Z They work perfectly for my homemade donuts!,1
"2017-08-15T03:05:22Z This is amazing!! I was shocked by how smooth, and tasty it was!! Usually I do not buy cocktail mixes but a friend recommended this one to me, and I am so glad she did. I love it! It will defiantly be a staple in my home and parties!!",1
"2017-12-01T08:01:02Z I purchased the 12 bottle mixed package to sample something new to me in the rose and meritage. I usually drink Pinot Noir and Chardonnay or Pinot Grigio. I wish the wines lived up to their descriptions, but sadly they did not. I realize tastes are subjective, but for me, the Chardonnay was very tart and without any full taste. I would not order these again..",0
"2018-01-02T20:20:01Z I will never order again! ""Two buck Chuck"" has better taste!",0
2018-01-02T20:20:02Z I purchased the Pinot Noir and it was terrible. Dumping it and won’t purchase again .,0
"2017-09-23T02:53:08Z I use Clamato to make Bloody Mary's, 1/2 Clamato, 1/4 vodka, 1/4 ZingZang. Mix and enjoy!",1
2017-08-15T03:05:22Z I wasn't too sure about this at first because it was so inexpensive...but thought I'd give it a shot. It far exceeded all expectations!!! So delicious and smooth!!! Super impressed! Plus it doesn't hurt that the guy on the bottle is cute...just sayin,1
"2018-01-02T20:20:01Z I have tried this wine before, but this batch was not good at all and I will never order again.",0
2017-09-20T01:18:35Z Rum Chata is great when mixed with Fireball or Caramel Vodka,1
"2017-09-23T02:53:08Z I love this and drink it without alcohol every day. But, it is practically non existent in the stores. You can find Bold Spicy but not this. And why does this cost almost 2.00 more per bottle then the Bold Spicy",1
2017-09-23T02:53:08Z This is very Convieant to use. You can just throw it in your purse. Also can get every last drop out.,1
2017-09-06T04:49:34Z Very small amount for the price. Won't make this mistake again! Disappointed to say the least!,0
2016-07-26T20:28:19Z This package arrived when they said it would - it was also packed beautifully - nothing broken!,1
"2017-09-02T07:55:36Z Actually, the Great Value crescent rolls in my area's Walmarts come in a white package with black and blue writing ... plus a picture of a couple beautiful crescent rolls. Nonetheless, I expect my experience with this brand and product is applicable. I bought 2 dozen of the various types -- flaky butter, reduced fat, and standard -- and all had the same problems to some degree. Although I was using the rolls up to 3 weeks prior to the 30JUN13 expiration date on the end-cap of the packages, the dough in many packages was so dry (old poorly stored) that it would stick to the packaging. And it was impossible to unroll the dough.. I had to pry off chunks ... and then try to put the chunks together like a jigsaw puzzle into some Frankenrolls. The other reviews say the SAME THING ... going back as far as 2009. And now I'm extending that same complaint to mid-2013. Why has Walmart continued to deal with the same supplier despite the same problem for AT LEAST 4 years My recommendation: Spend the extra 24 cents (or whatever) on the real thing: Pillsbury crescent rolls.",0
"2017-08-05T04:29:00Z This stuff has just the right amount of heat - enough to be worth using, but not so much that you can make your cocktails undrinkable without effort. I put it in any cocktail that needs a little bite, and have been happy with the results.",1
2017-11-13T16:03:41Z This whole order was a nightmare from day one ...after almost 2 weeks it came I wish it didn���t...I gifted 2 bottles to my son & when he sent me a text how awful it was & that he dumped it down the drain I was horrified to say the least ...luckily it was my son because I bought these for holiday gifts ...QVC needs more quality control for items like this we work hard for our money & spending it on something I will be dumping down the drain is not acceptable...I was refunded my money but it still is very upsetting that this Vintage wine Estates sells such garbage to a reputable company like QVC,0
2017-09-02T07:55:32Z Delish. Extremely good,1
2017-09-23T23:01:18Z This is my favorite bourbon. I even love its aroma. It has that nice vanilla scent going on. I never get tired of Jim Beam Black.,1
2017-09-20T01:18:35Z Great for Bloody Mary's or a dressed chelada!,1
2017-09-02T07:55:36Z The dough was not was to unroll or separate. Disappointed,0
"2017-09-23T02:53:08Z I bought this product to protect my lips from the hot desert sun and it works great!! I love, love, love my little yellow jar!!",1
"2018-01-02T20:20:02Z If you're a selective wine drinker, don't buy this. It's mediocre at best. Will likely end up using for cooking.",0
2017-09-20T01:18:35Z We have been drinking this wine for 10+ years. It's just a good every day table wine that will not break the bank.,1
"2017-11-14T20:55:13Z I have purchased this wine with various cheaper brands and have liked it FAR more. Seemed very sour to me. Not mellow at all. PLUS, they did not mention that you need to sign for this wine during the presentation. Just they now deliver to PA. I found this out while tracking . My luck I was home the day of delivery. Will go to the local state store for my regular brand.",0
2017-01-30T18:37:07Z I have been drinking this Apothic California Crush for the past six months and find it totally refreshing. It is so smooth and flavorable. One bottle is usually not enough and I tend to buy six bottles at a time. Fortunately the price in Alaska is much cheaper which makes it even more desirable!,0
"2017-08-05T04:28:58Z Dump the plastic dropper rod attached to the cap immediately on receipt it pulls right off. Whether or not you like the taste of the product (I was pleased enough), the 4-inch plastic dropper rod, while very handy for adding drops of the bitters to one's drink in a measured manner, is made from an extremely foul source.Discovered this after having finished off a bottle of Bittermen's Grapefruit Bitters and leaving it on the shelf for a month, then opened up the bottle to add some gin and absorb the remains of the bitters to the quite empty bottle. An extremely foul toxic smell emerged immediately investigating, I found it to unmistakably be the plastic dropper rod attached to the bottle cap. While immersed in the strong-smelling and -tasting bitters solution, it's disguised. When not, well, ... it is just revolting. Try it see for yourself.No one should be ingesting any substance steeped in this material. Bittermen's, you really gotta clean up your act with that dropper rod.",0
2017-08-05T04:28:57Z Did not like the flavor of these,0
"2018-01-10T11:51:07Z I have been enjoying Jim Beam Original for many years. I started mixing JB-O with Slice while wife and I watched Dallas. I have tried other whiskeys, but keep coming back to JB. Now I enjoy it mixed with Diet Pepsi (since I can no longer find Slice).",1
"2017-07-25T05:50:17Z Don't waste your money. Over-rated, over-priced. You could make your own by looking up an online recipe and wouldn't be able to tell the difference.",0
2017-09-02T07:55:36Z Not soft like Orowheat!! Feel disappointed,0
2017-09-20T01:18:35Z Seriously You ask what's great about it What isn't great about it,1
"2016-07-26T20:28:24Z I almost cant believe all of the good reviews for these wines. We pretty much couldn't even drink them because they are so sweet, thick and jammy. Like fruit juice. We started with the Pinot Noir and after a few sips, aerating and then a few more sips with dinner, we just poured it out. It did not resemble any Pinot I've had before. So we moved on to the Cabernet - and it was almost the same thing. I haven't tried the Merlot yet but not looking forward to it. If I had bought these at a local shop they would be returned. Unfortunately, I that's not an option since they are open and mail order. Maybe the rest can be frozen for cooking. I do love that this producer gives back to charities, more companies should follow their lead in that respect.",0
"2017-09-20T01:18:35Z My buddy ordered some shots of this stuff during a horns game. Frankly when it comes to tequila, I usually brace myself for a rough shot. Maybe I'm drinking the wrong stuff, because this was really easy to put back. No lingering aftertaste. Reasonably priced. Good value tequila if you're looking.",1
"2016-07-26T20:28:24Z The Merlot was harsh, it has my throat burning like moonshine. Never tasted wine like this before. Hope it is just a bad bottle",0
2017-09-07T18:14:19Z thise wine is a copy cat of the original. Not nice and the taste is terrible.,0
"2017-09-23T02:53:08Z I have a lip balm jar in my car, in my night stand and in my purse. Use it on a daily basis and would certainly hate to run out. It is wonderful stuff, and smells god too.",1
2017-09-23T02:53:08Z This is always a nessesity on my shopping cart!!! :),1
"2017-08-05T04:28:59Z On the advice of a highly knowledgeable relative, I bought this as a stocking stuffer for another family member. It was a big hit, and I must say, very interesting addition to a cocktail. Now I need some.",1
"2017-09-02T07:55:36Z First off, I could not get the package open. Then, when I opened it, there was no way to roll out the crescent shapes to form actual crescents. I had to break off bits of dough, roll them in my hands, and make drop biscuits. Terrible!",0
2017-09-23T02:53:08Z I've been using this since the 80's...always loved it...never gonna change!!,1
2017-08-15T03:05:22Z I used this Manhattan Mixer at our weekend pool party and it was an absolute hit!!! Cocktails were delicious and simple to make. It was one of the conversational pieces of the party!!!,1
"2017-09-06T04:49:34Z Mr. Mrs. at its best! If you haven't tried it, you haven't lived. Walmart is the place to buy no matter what size your bank account is.",1
"2017-09-06T04:49:34Z This product did not have any flavor, it was very bland to call itself spicy.",0
"2017-11-15T17:05:21Z You get what you pay for, I got it for $8.25 a bottle and that's about all it is worth. I should of known better. but it's free s&h,. I was disappointed it's all from the same vintner and not as the labels show different wineries. It was just the ease of delivery. I live in California and have so many options of good wines. One and only purchase. Q does not know good wines!",0
2017-09-02T07:55:36Z Not as good as pilsbury. The cressants did not come off easily. They stuck together. Terrible experience,0
"2017-09-20T01:18:33Z We opened the bag and see nice sized chunks of chicken. We were mistaken, we see maybe 3 or 4 pieces of good sized chunks but the rest were tiny and mostly breading.",0
2017-09-20T01:18:35Z Are you not selling Oak Leaf wine in a box anymore We have been to 2 different Wal Marts without finding any. This in a box is great. Please do not stop carrying it.,1
2017-09-23T02:53:08Z I buy at least 5 of these things every 6 months. I use it everyday along with all my family members also!,1
2017-09-23T02:53:08Z I love this! My favorite! Works well for cold sores too. I refuse to buy any other product.,1
2017-09-20T01:18:35Z They have a good chocolate taste.,1
2017-09-06T04:49:34Z really tasty especially for someone who doesn't have experience making drinks. Tastes as good or better than a bar or restaurant with a fraction of the cost,1
2017-07-11T20:52:17Z These chalk are cheap but I guess you get what you pay for because they don't write well. :-/,0
"2018-01-02T20:20:01Z I'm not a wine drinker but have relatives and friends who are, so I purchased 12 bottles to have on hand at home and also for gifts. My brother visited this weekend and I opened the red wine for him to enjoy during a football game. He tried to be gracious but finally said it just wasn't good. Now I'm wondering what the people thought who received wine as gifts. I have eight bottles left and wondering if I should just pour them down the drain. What a disappointment after the hosts all ooo-ed and ahhh-ed over this supposedly fabulous wine assortment.",0
"2017-09-02T07:55:36Z If I could give these crescent rolls less that a full star rating, I would! I would even give it a negative star. Of course, whenever you buy any pre made dough in a pop can, you expect a POP! Well, nothing happenedat first. I had to bang it on the counter to open, and when it did, it was more of a BANG than a pop, and dough shot out all over the place. The dough that was salvageable, in no way resembled a crescent. I had to form it into triangles by myself, of course the dough was so sticky that it was nearly impossible. The taste of the finished rolls did however taste the same as name brand rolls, but the measly few cents saved to purchase the great value brand was not worth the extra work, and mess to purchase. From now on, I know to go with a more reputable brand.",0
"2017-09-23T02:53:08Z I use it everyday just before applying lipstick, i really have dry cracked lips and my carmix is really a day saver",1
2017-09-20T01:18:33Z Hot and irregular cuts of chicken,0
2017-09-06T04:49:34Z Not very tasty at all. Terrible.,0
2017-09-20T01:18:35Z I love everything about Jim Beam Apple... The taste is great and it goes down smooth! It's one of the best drinks out there with or without any added mixes....,1
"2017-09-20T01:18:35Z I purchased this item to make Mimosas and had some left over. The mimosas were delicious. I found the California Champaign tasteless when too cold and just right at a lesser temperature. Of course it is not Dom Perignon but who would make Mimosas with Dom, anyway",1
2017-09-20T01:18:35Z Battle ground walmart is to high priced to surrounding stores,1
"2017-09-20T01:18:35Z I'm a very picky about buying prepackaged anything, but these are SOOOO good!!!",1
2017-09-20T01:18:33Z The chicken did not have much flavor and tasted cheap.,0
2017-09-20T01:18:35Z My Kids loved these,1
2017-09-20T01:18:35Z This is the best bourbon under 50 you can buy. One of the smoothest bourbons I've tasted. I typically drink Woodford Reserve or Eagle Rare until I tried this. I buy a bottle every two weeks now.,1
"2017-08-05T04:28:58Z This product is fantastic, and I haven't yet found anything that can really take its place. When I got it, I took out the dropper and dripped a little right on my tongue and instantly fell in love. It has the depth and complexity of flavor you expect from bitters, but it's not overwhelming. I love a glass of rum with just a couple dashes of this in it, or in an East India Trading Co. cocktail (with rum, sherry and amaro liqueur). I highly recommend.",1
"2018-01-02T20:20:01Z The cab was the only drinkable one. Using for cooking wine. For that reason, Mr Wonderful, I'm out.",0
"2017-09-02T07:55:36Z These were terrible!!! It seems like they are just crammed into the packaging. There is no way to roll them out into triangles. It just comes out all smashed together and impossible to actually make crescent rolls out of them. I ended up having to roll it all out and make my own! Too much work! Next time I will be spending the extra 0.30 or so and going with Pillsbury!! Heck, I'd even pay 5.00 more to not deal with this garbage!",0
"2018-01-02T20:20:01Z Thought this would be a good sampler of wine at a very decent price. The mixed case has some wine that friends liked, some I liked. But overall the case is just non descript. Chardonnay was very light on the oaky taste. Other whites were OK. Meritage is OK. Pinot Noir was unidentifiable as such. Cab Sauv. OK. White Zin? No one wanted it. So I can't say this was a ""wonderful"" assortment. I have cancelled the remainder of the auto ship. Thanks anyway, Kevin. I'll pick my own bottles locally.",0
2017-08-15T03:05:22Z This product is so simple and easy to use !! I've tried different manhatan mixes before and this one is by far my favorite! It meshes very well w any burbon and the flavors don't overpower and try to mask the burbon like other products !!! It's an essential to my mini bar at home !!AMAZING PRODUCT!!,1
2018-01-09T13:24:13Z Just bad wine. The worst I have ever had. Try Bota Box Sarah is you are looking for a decent boxed wine.,0
2017-09-20T01:18:35Z Used at Birthday Party and everyone enjoyed it. Will purchase again,1
"2017-11-15T17:05:21Z I bought 2 of the wine collections; one in the mixed of white & red and one in the all reds. The only one we thought was somewhat decent was the Chardonnay. The funny thing is, we aren't even Chardonnay drinkers! We both thought that one was the only consumable wine. Still bad but the best of the whole lot of wines. Rose was the next best but very tart, pulling slightly sour and not in a good way. Both the Pinot & Cab Sauv were very sour, almost like corked wine tastes. It burned when you drank it, like you were drinking straight rubbing alcohol. Gross! We brought them to the correct temp, let them breathe, etc... but they are just straight up nasty. Was a big disappointment as we were really looking forward to getting them and being on auto-delivery. I'm giving 2 stars since the packaging of wine in the boxes & the shipping was great as well as QVC customer service. I called & explained everything to QVC and immediately received a refund!! No hassles, questions, etc... just immediately refunded the 2 payments I already made. While the wines disappointed, QVC did not! Thank you QVC, this is exactly why I will remain a loyal shopper!!",0
"2017-08-15T03:30:40Z the product advertise said 15pk, I have no idea what that means but I assumed it was going to be 15 pack - it turned out to be one bottle for 2.50 - less expensive to buy at the store! It does not make any sense.",0
2017-08-05T04:28:57Z Great selection of different flavors for a starter set.,1
2015-11-13T12:25:24Z Pretty good app. Linked me to my other apps no punching in all your info over and over. Quick n easy!!,1
2017-09-20T01:18:33Z Was very dry. Disappointed.,0
2017-11-15T17:05:21Z Wish this could be a positive review but not this time.Found the reds to be lacking greatly in aroma (nose) and both with an unpleasant finish.Usually we have been pleased overall with the wines but this is a definite miss for us.,0
"2017-09-23T02:53:08Z The Clamato Cocktail is the best juice i have tasted in a long time. I have a small glass with every dinner. Good flavor, Great Taste.",1
2018-01-09T21:14:11Z These have to be the most addicting oreos ever. The chocolate cookie with a marshmallow like center is wonderful but not over powering. VERY GOOD!!!,1
2017-09-20T01:18:35Z Sweet and tasty,1
2017-09-20T01:18:33Z We usually buy the Tyson Any'tizer boneless wings but bought these to save a little money. BIG MISTAKE! These wings have twice the sodium as the Tyson chicken and you can definitely tell by the taste. We ended up throwing the whole bag away. Next time we'll spend the extra dollar.,0
"2017-09-23T02:53:08Z the best product on the market, you cant go wrong using it !",1
2017-09-06T04:49:34Z I love that you get 98 ounces and that its less than 6. It makes great margaritas too. I hate that its not available in store because its great for parties.,1
"2016-07-26T20:28:12Z These wines were a happy surprise! I bought an assortment of wines for a house warming party last weekend and these were great. White cat was like a Sweet Mascoto, Cabin Fever had a sweet taste all it own, I Red Cat was also sweet, I don't care for red wine but this was good! The Breathable Berry reminded me of a Sangria.This brand is on the top of my list, I will buy more of their wines!",1
"2018-01-10T18:06:29Z Refreshing, nice grapefruit flavor. Not for people that dislike seltzer water. It's good out of the can or poured over ice.",1
2017-09-23T02:53:08Z I have used this product since I was in my teens. It is been my favorite product and I will continue to use it.,1
"2017-08-15T03:05:22Z After tasting the smooth flavor of this mix, I discovered a more natural way to enjoy a manhattan!!",1
2017-09-23T02:53:08Z Addictively tasty!,1
2017-08-15T03:05:22Z Refreshing. Simple. Delicious. Can't wait to use this mix for all my summer get togethers!,1
"2017-08-05T04:28:58Z Just a friendly reminder: Shrub bitters are bitters that contain lots of vinegar. If the thought of drinking a bottle of vinegar sounds appealing to you, then you may enjoy this. If it doesn't, then you do NOT want these. (Take a whiff and it smells like someone dying easter eggs.) (If you want a spicy bitter that's not a shrub, try Scrappy's Habanero firewater bitters instead!)",0
"2017-08-05T04:28:57Z To the people who don't think things like bitters and muddled fruit don't make any difference in a drink, they couldn't be more wrong. This habenero shrub bitter adds a real dimension to the cocktail and anyone serious about their drink should have this.",1
2017-09-04T10:06:07Z No better tasting mustard on a brat!,1
2017-09-23T02:53:08Z I've used this many times over the years and have never been disappointed in it.,1
"2016-07-26T20:28:12Z Red cat is my favorite wine of all time.The Red Cat itself is sweet but not too much so, with a little tartness.The White Cat is light and refreshing especially ice cold, same goes with the Cabin Fever.The best out of the 4 in my opinion though is Bramble berry. Tart, sweet and tastes like berry jam. I love it!",1
2017-08-09T23:06:54Z Wonderful. We moved to a small town and I could no longer buy Goya cooking wines locally. Love the wine for cooking and the larger bottles are far more affordable than buying multiple smaller bottles of other brands. Wish I had thought of Amazon months ago!,1
2017-11-15T17:05:21Z I realize this is an inexpensive bottle of wine but it is tasteless. Will not buy wine from QVC again.,0
"2017-09-20T01:18:35Z If you're going to take the time a pressure wash your driveway or your house, this is not worth the time or effort. The nozzle is so small and the actual dirt that comes off is the same amount from a normal hose.",0
"2017-09-02T07:55:36Z The dough looked like it was crammed into the packaging. I could not use it without combining the dough to roll out and cut wedges myself. Then they came out hard and very small. It must've been at the end of the line and what was left over. This has happened more than once, will not purchase again. The savings is not worth it.",0
2018-01-10T05:58:01Z Very good for the price,1
2017-04-19T16:58:47Z Just what I expected good product.,1
2017-09-20T01:18:35Z drink,1
2015-11-06T01:25:54Z Perfect gift for my father for the holidays. Been a family favorite for a long time.,1
2017-09-23T02:53:08Z I have been using car ex for years and swear by it!,1
"2017-09-04T19:13:22Z Yuck. I'm the type who usually rants and raves over Trump brands, but this wine is AWFUL. Was so shocked, I spilled it ALL OVER my favorite brown shirt. Sad!",0
2017-09-23T02:53:08Z I've been using this for quite a while. I use the jar at night and keep a tube in my purse. I love the products.,1
2017-11-15T17:05:21Z This whole order was a nightmare from day one ...after almost 2 weeks it came I wish it didn’t...I gifted 2 bottles to my son & when he sent me a text how awful it was & that he dumped it down the drain I was horrified to say the least ...luckily it was my son because I bought these for holiday gifts ...QVC needs more quality control for items like this we work hard for our money & spending it on something I will be dumping down the drain is not acceptable...I was refunded my money but it still is very upsetting that this Vintage wine Estates sells such garbage to a reputable company like QVC,0
"2017-08-09T23:06:54Z Nothing wrong with Goya cooking wine, it's great. What's wrong here is the price. I can buy this exact product at my supermarket for 2.79.",0
2017-09-23T02:53:08Z I was introduced to this when I entered the Army. In the PX there was tons of this stuff. All of us recruits got a jar and boy were we glad! It helped us get thru a horrible Oklahoma winter. 23 years later I never forgot how it saved me and still use it to this day. I'm sure those guys do too!,1
2018-01-10T05:38:33Z Just so so. Seems to be missing something. There are much better margarita mixes out there without all the additives this does not have.,0
"2018-01-09T13:19:50Z Taste was absolutely fine for a 5 Chardonnay. However, BOTH bottles broke while removing the corkscrew. Second break was far enough I didn't want to risk drinking it because of risk of glass shards. I've bought cheaper wines like yellowtail, etc, and NEVER experienced a bottle breaking.",0
"2018-01-02T20:20:01Z Delivery was a little slow but it was worth the wait. I was very pleased with the Moscato selection. It arrived in excellent condition, which indicates it was well packaged. The price was very reasonable.",1
"2017-09-20T01:18:35Z If I'm going to buy a Sangria, this is not the one I'd choose. The flavor was not as fruity as others I've had and was not pleasant for my palate.",0
2018-01-10T18:59:18Z My favorite bottle design. The best cheap lager.,1
2017-09-23T02:53:08Z I always keep this beside my bed. It's the only stuff that will stay on while I sleep.,1
"2017-09-20T01:18:33Z These chicken wyngz were gross. Way too much breading, and the taste of buffalo sauce was barely noticeable. At the price Walmart sells these at, I can't recommend them on any level.",0
"2017-08-05T04:29:00Z So the Habanero Bitters are great in a version of a Margarita we do that traditionally used tabasco. I like this at least as much and you don't get any of the vinegar flavor one does from Tabasco.Also, LOVE the tiki bitters and a bitter monk is my new favorite cocktail just because I get to use this in it.Great stuff.",1
"2017-09-20T01:18:35Z I only stumbled upon this after reading it's apparently created by Walmart, it's a private label brand from what I read, not sure how true that is, but the taste was good all throughout, but I still have 2 or 3 left in the case to try, at a little less than a dollar per can, the price can't be beat, if you want to try something different lol....",1
2017-08-05T04:28:58Z I've tried this in a few drinks so far and none have turned out tasting any good.I wrote to the company and asked if they had any suggestions for using it but they never responded.Probably will just sit on the shelf now until I get tired of seeing it and toss it.,0
2015-11-13T12:25:24Z Quick and easy.,1
"2016-07-26T20:28:19Z We really enjoy this wine and the name is very unique. Great for gifts, outstanding taste. Would definitely recommend and purchase again. Thanks.",1
"2016-01-21T08:02:43Z This wine is the best cab for the money I've ever had. Sometimes a 10 cab tastes like a 20 cab, and that's a bargain wine for sure. This Washington Cabernet Sauvignon from Naked Winery drinks like a 40+ cabernet. So try it now! This is not a fruity oak bomb, nor a lengthy, earthy, subtle cab.Here are my 2-liner tasting notes:Black currant and dark cherry on the nose lead to hints of clove and praline on the palate. Medium tannins. An elegant, smoky barrel toast on the finish.",1
2017-09-02T07:55:36Z ok for replacement but still not as good on brand name product,0
2017-09-20T01:18:35Z Previous bottles stated aged nine years. Last bottle purchased shows no age. Taste appeared a little harsher than previously. Horrible and terrible. So disappointed.,0
"2017-11-15T17:05:21Z Can't believe that I was so stupid to fall for Kevin O'Leary's promotion of his wines. I believed in him, and therefore went ahead and purchased the variety.dozen bottles. What a fool I have been! I wanted to give him the benefit of doubt, but I continue to be disappointed. Yes, I know I have a month to return the merchandise! What a laugh!! How to return a huge package? I poured most in the kitchen sink... live and learn.",0
2017-08-05T04:28:58Z Great!,1
"2017-09-23T02:53:08Z This is so basic in my life, I can't stop using it!",1
"2017-11-14T20:55:13Z I purchased these to give as gifts last year and when I tried the wine myself I spit it out and was mortified.I was so embarrassed that I gave these wines to people I know that I had to apologize and give another gift.This is by far some of the worst swill I���ve ever had.There are wines that are the same price from California wineries that are far superior.I would not even cook with this stuff, it is quite terrible.I wish I had discovered the poor quality and the offensive taste during the return period because they would have gone back. This is what they had in mind when they coined the expression ���rot gut���. Disappointed. ",0
"2017-09-07T20:13:07Z I'm the computer person, but the good wife says that these cured her constipation 10 years ago and won't be without them",1
2017-09-02T07:55:36Z They fall apart when you get them out of package. They are different sizes too. They look like someone just threw them in the package when you open it unlike Pillsbury crescent rolls.,0
"2017-09-23T02:53:08Z Been using since HS, 30 yrs ago. Never lets me dry up!",1
2017-11-15T17:05:21Z I was so happy to see Rose lincluded in this set instead of sweet Zinfandel. Unfortunately this rose was sweeter than Zinfandel. Very disappointed! Terrible.,0
2017-09-20T01:18:35Z Add tequila or just seltzer and a slice of fresh lime to make a virgin margarita. It's great both ways! Perfect for summer entertaining! sweepstakes This review was collected as part of a promotion.,1
2017-09-23T02:53:08Z I grew up with this stuff. My mom always had a jar on her. I'll buy this product forever.,1
2017-09-20T01:18:35Z Best tasteing and defenetly the smoothest around I love it!,1
"2017-09-02T07:55:32Z Next to homemade, this is awesome!",1
2017-07-19T22:07:21Z I ordered 12 of these buckets and when I opened them up a couple of the buckets had holes in the bottom. The Margarita was good. Disappointed about the holes.,0
2017-09-20T01:18:35Z I had a neat 2 finger glass two weeks ago of JB Black label for the first time (I've always drank Jack Daniels) and I loved it! No more Jack for me!,1
"2017-09-20T01:18:35Z This Roscato is sweet. Very crisp and mildly sweet, but it is delicious",1
2018-01-10T05:58:02Z This is by far the best reisling I've ever had! LOVE it! Always consistent in flavor and my go to!,1
"2017-08-15T03:05:22Z I have a manhattan almost everyday after work. My wife bought me this to try and although it is decent, it is not necessary. Spend your money on quality vermouth and of course the best bourbon one can afford. Disappointed in the taste.",0
2017-09-02T07:55:36Z Very difficult to separate into individual rolls . It is terrible. Very disappointed.,0
"2017-07-28T12:38:56Z Bought this for my parents. They said it was awful and tasted very chemical. They love margaritas, so I bought this after reading reviews. Won't do that again! Terrible and very disappointed.",0
2017-09-20T01:18:35Z Best tasteing and defenetly the smoothest around I love it!,1
"2017-08-15T03:05:22Z Not personally into pre made mixes, but bought this for entertaining friends the other night. Was extremely impressed! So smooth and balanced! Everyone LOVED their manhattans! All you have to do is add your whiskey or bourbon of choice. There are no artificial flavors or high fructose corn syrups in the mix either. Just pure cane sugar. Honestly probably safer than using the liqueurs on the market! As a bartender myself I'm telling you to get this product!!",1
2017-09-20T01:18:35Z Taste Great portion,1
"2017-08-05T04:28:58Z Does not taste like habaneros what so ever. Very disappointing, not to mention you have to pour half the bottle in your tiny drink to taste it. Terrible to be honest.",0
